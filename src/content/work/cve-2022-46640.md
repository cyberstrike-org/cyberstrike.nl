  We cooperated with Nanoleaf to find vulnerabilities in their desktop application.
  After an extensive research period we found several critical vulnerabilities in their 
  desktop application to manage their IoT devices. The most severe vulnerability was an 
  unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability, which allowed an attacker to take 
  over the device running the application by sending an network packet. Considering the
  possibly major impact of this vulnerability, we followed a very strict vulnerability
  disclosure protocol. 

  The vulnerability got dubbed as [CVE-2022-46640](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46640)
  with a rating of 9.8/10 (critical) by NIST. The exact vector of the vulnerability is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
